# 📚 Book Recommender System

A **web-based book recommendation system** built using **Streamlit** and a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model.  
This application provides **personalized book recommendations** using **collaborative filtering**, helping users discover new books they might enjoy based on user rating patterns.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Model Training**  
   - Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and training a **KNN model** to find similarities between books.  

2. **Web Application Deployment**  
   - A **Streamlit application** that loads the trained model and serves real-time recommendations through an interactive UI.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Suggests books based on collaborative filtering (user rating patterns).  
- 🎨 **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.  
- 🌙 **Aesthetic Design**: Modern UI with **dark theme** and custom CSS.  
- 💾 **Model Persistence**: Trained model & data are saved and reloaded without retraining.
